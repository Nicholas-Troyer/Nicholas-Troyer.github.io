		<h1>This one of the hobbies I have.</h1>
		
		<p>
			In my free time between work and college I, at this point in time, do the most repeated task that everyone my age has been done, and been doing, playing video games. <br>
			These games can vary from genre to genre, strategy to First Person Shooters, to even simple games such as Tetris. <br>
			And here is a picture of a game called Europa Univeralis 4. A grand strategy game taking place from 1444 to 1821 where you take control of a nation.
